Build a MEAN stack app containing  3 pages which would scrape images from google search and store it in your server: 
1- A page containing an input field and a submit button to Fetch images from google and save top 15 images after passing through a compression algorithm then pass it through a black and white filter and upload all the images to a particular location(Amazon S3 or local HDD).
2- A page which lists all the keywords searched before by the user.
3- After clicking on any word on the listing page open up another page which will have all the images for that particular keyword, but this time the images should be loaded from the location/path on which you saved/cached those images
